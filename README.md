# galc
Simple terminal-driven RPN calculator

## Installation

```
$ go get github.com/Shamus03/galc
$ galk
```

## Controls

Type numbers.  Use the four basic operations.  Enter to push a number onto the stack for later use.

%/^ are square root and square respectively.

Ctrl-c to quit.

I modeled the basic behavior off of a HP-41C because that was my go-to calculator in college.
